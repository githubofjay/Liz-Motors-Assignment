https://investors.canoo.com/company-information/faq,"On December 18, 2020, Canoo and DD Global Holdings Limited (“DD Global”), a global investment firm, entered into a National Security Agreement with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, acting through its monitoring agencies, which required DD Global to reduce its ownership in Canoo by predetermined dates or transfer its shares beneficially owned in Canoo to a voting trust (see 8-K for additional details). On October 6, 2021, an entity affiliated with AFV Partners LLC (“AFV”), which is led by Canoo’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tony Aquila, entered into an agreement to purchase 53.6 million shares of Canoo common stock beneficially owned by DD Global at a price of $6.53 per share, reflecting a 10 percent discount to the 30-day trailing VWAP as of September 14, 2021.  The parties anticipate that upon consummation of the proposed transaction (if and when it is consummated), DD Global will satisfy all of the ownership limitations set forth under the National Security Agreement."

The shares acquired pursuant to the proposed transaction are subject to transfer and lockup restrictions until the earlier of (i) the completion of an equity offering by Canoo and (b) six months from the anniversary date of the signing of the lockup agreement. During the lockup period, AFV will have a right of first refusal to purchase the shares retained by DD Global. AFV also retains its option to purchase an additional 2.4 million shares from DD Global at price of $5.83 per share, per the terms of a previously disclosed option agreement, dated May 18, 2021 (see Item 3 here for additional details), which will not be exercised in connection with the proposed transaction."

Los Angeles / Seoul, Feb 11/12, 2020 –Hyundai Motor Group and Canoo  announced today that Hyundai has engaged Canoo to jointly develop an  electric vehicle (EV) platform based on Canoo’s proprietary skateboard  design for upcoming Hyundai and Kia models. As part of the collaboration, Canoo will provide engineering services to help  develop a fully scalable, all-electric platform to meet Hyundai and Kia  specifications. Hyundai Motor Group expects the platform to help facilitate  its commitment to delivering cost competitive electrified vehicles —ranging  from small-sized EVs to Purpose Built Vehicles (PBV) —that meet diverse  customer needs. [Canoo] offers a skateboard platform which houses the most critical  components of the vehicle with a strong emphasis on functional integration,  meaning all components fulfill as many functions as possible. This feat of  engineering reduces the skateboard size, weight and total number of parts,  which ultimately provides more interior cabin space and a more cost- effective EV offering. In addition, the Canoo skateboard is a self-contained  unit that can be paired with any cabin design. Hyundai Motor Group expects an adaptable all-electric platform using Canoo’s scalable skateboard architecture to allow for a simplified and standardized  development process for Hyundai and Kia electrified vehicles, which is expected to help reduce cost that can be passed along to consumers. Hyundai Motor Group  also expects to reduce complexity of its EV assembly line, allowing for rapid response to changing market demands and customer preferences. With this collaboration, Hyundai Motor Group doubles down on its recent commitment to invest $87 billion USD over the next five years to foster future growth. As  part of this drive, Hyundai plans to invest $52 billion USD in future technologies through 2025, while Kia will invest $25 billion USD in electrification and future  mobility technologies, aiming for eco-friendly vehicles to comprise 25% of its total sales by 2025."

https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"Canoo’s vehicle is purposefully designed to offer maximum productivity, efficiency, class-leading cargo volume and cost savings"
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"Los Angeles, CA – (December 17, 2020) – Canoo, a company developing breakthrough electric vehicles (EVs), revealed today its all-electric multi-purpose delivery vehicle to be priced starting at approximately $33,000.[i] The vehicle is purposefully designed to maximize return on investment for its customers. It is based on Canoo’s proprietary electric platform and will be offered in two initial size variants, with others to follow. Limited availability will begin in 2022, with scaled production and launch planned for 2023. With its multi-purpose delivery vehicle, Canoo plans to offer customers best-in-class total cost of ownership, class-leading cargo volume, and functionally-designed features.[ii] Customers can pre-order the multi-purpose delivery vehicle for a refundable deposit of $100 per vehicle at www.canoo.com/mpdv. "
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv, 
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"“We created our multi-purpose delivery vehicle from the inside out, with the ergonomics of the driver in mind and with attention to detail to help them be happier and more productive at work,” said Tony Aquila, Executive Chairman, Canoo. “The vehicle is affordable and offers greater cargo capacity than the current electric delivery offerings in its class. We aim to lower the total cost of ownership and increase return on investment for everyone from local small business owners to large fleets.” "
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv, 
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,Multi-Purpose for Multiple Use Cases
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"As an integral part of Canoo’s business strategy, the functional design of the multi-purpose delivery vehicle is meant to service a wide range of customers. It was built specifically with the needs of small businesses and large last-mile delivery companies in mind. The design of the model paired with the best-in-class total cost of ownership (TCO) also makes it a great option for independent contractors, utilities, service technicians and many more. "
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv, 
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"Large customers, such as last-mile and package delivery fleets, retailers, major corporations and logistics companies, also have the option to co-develop a custom vehicle with Canoo to meet their specific requirements."
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv, 
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,Best-in-Class Total Cost of Ownership & Cargo Volume 
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"With this vehicle, Canoo plans to achieve best-in-class total cost of ownership through range and space efficiency, as well as durability and low maintenance costs. Leveraging the company’s proprietary platform is expected to reduce material and service costs, passing on considerable savings to customers. "
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv, 
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"Canoo’s proprietary electric vehicle platform is the flattest in the industry and has enabled potentially class-leading interior cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Interior volume is also maximized through Canoo’s signature driver-forward architecture, which was designed with safety in mind. Canoo estimates that its multi-purpose delivery vehicle customers can achieve between $50,000 to $80,000 improvement on return on capital over six to seven years, depending on the use case, as compared to other top selling delivery vehicles. "
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv, 
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,Productivity is our Passion
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"To maximize user functionality, the production vehicle plans to offer a bi-directional onboard charger in lieu of adding a separate DC-AC converter, which will transform the vehicle into a power plant for equipment and tools. A 125V or 240V AC output power plug can be incorporated into the vehicle so tools such as saws, drills and air compressors can be conveniently powered up at remote destinations. The vehicle also enables various workstations. For example, drivers who have to take notes per delivery or job will have the ability to place a laptop or other devices to the left of the driver's seat. "
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv, 
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"The vehicle was designed from the inside out to be sensitive to the ergonomics and productivity of the people using it. Additional vehicle customization examples that focus on ergonomics and productivity gains include high roof height, storage lockers, roll-up style door, ramp slide outs and more.[iii] Both vehicle variants are designed to offer a low step in height of 17 inches, allowing easy and comfortable access to the vehicle. With the space efficiency afforded by Canoo’s multi-purpose delivery vehicle, fleets can accommodate higher storage capacities to meet the increasing demands of their customers. "
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv, 
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"The vehicle enables greater “up time,” or the actual hours of use, through a range of unique benefits, including: "
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv, 
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,● Greater cargo space with nearly 30% more parcel volume than other leading delivery vehicles in comparable segments.
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"● Range efficiency means more stops can be made on a single charge, helping to lower operating costs. "
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,● Energy efficiency provides considerable savings in terms of operating expenses because the vehicle can go further per kilowatt of energy than the competition.
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,● Urban maneuverability enabled by Canoo’s steer-by-wire technology which eliminates hand-over-hand driving and increases range of motion and route options.  
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv, 
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,Anticipated Vehicle Specifications[iv]
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"The multi-purpose delivery vehicle is a ground up electric design, meaning it was not retrofitted or designed based off of a gas- or diesel-powered model. This has enabled a more thoughtful, reliable and efficient EV design made specifically for people to use the vehicle as a workspace, such as plugging in their tools for a remote job."
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv, 
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"The multi-purpose delivery vehicle will be built on Canoo’s proprietary EV platform which features a steel frame construction, transverse composite leaf springs, a double wishbone suspension system, variable ratio steer-by-wire and brake-by-wire. The vehicle will be fully connected with data reporting capabilities and will feature Level 2.5 autonomy and over-the-air software updates. The vehicle will also support cutting-edge software-as-a-service (SaaS) to help fleets improve their total cost of professional ownership (TCPO) by allowing them to manage their assets, route plan, run diagnostics and support drivers with safety, awareness and ergonomic information. Canoo’s industry leading steer-by-wire system will enable a smooth transition into self-driving capabilities once full autonomy becomes commercially available. Steer-by-wire also helps accelerate the internationalization plans for the vehicle, allowing for rapid deployment of a right-hand drive offering. "
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv, 
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"The two vehicle variants, multi-purpose delivery vehicle 1 (MPDV1) and multi-purpose delivery vehicle 2 (MPDV2), are expected to offer three battery sizes—80, 60 and 40 kilowatt-hours (kWh)—with the 80-kWh size featuring a DC Fast Charging time of 28 minutes from 20% to 80% charge. "

https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"As companies are increasingly pressured by both regulators and consumers to reduce their carbon footprint, the adoption of EVs among commercial delivery vehicles is expected to see a dramatic increase. This shift is projected to be led by the light commercial vehicle segment, an initial target segment for Canoo. The demand for EV light commercial vehicles in the United States, Europe and China is expected to grow at a 33% CAGR from 2019 to 2028, according to BloombergNEF."
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv, 
https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"Further, the growth and increase in efficiency of e-commerce has resulted in a change in consumer expectations with e-commerce providers increasingly pushing to reduce package delivery times from two days to the same day. According to Canoo commissioned research, it is projected that same day parcel delivery volumes in the United States will grow to 10 billion parcels by 2030, reflecting an approximate 23% annual growth rate since 2019. This change is expected to result in an increase in demand for smaller delivery vehicles that can efficiently execute smaller volume and more frequent delivery routes."

https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"While a number of EV companies have recently announced plans to produce delivery vehicles, the last-mile delivery market is an entirely distinct segment and classification of vehicle differentiated from larger and midsize delivery vehicles and trucks. Last-mile delivery vehicles operate in predominantly urban environments with diverse use cases, thus requiring a compact size and maneuverability. The vehicles used are generally from the light commercial vehicles segment and a majority of the vehicles are from the class 1 category. "

https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,"These class 1 vehicles carry the same stringent regulatory and crash testing requirements that passenger cars are subjected to. Canoo’s platform, which is specifically designed for class 1 vehicles, has been validated to support these crash requirements via its passenger vehicle program. This provides Canoo a significant competitive advantage as most of the players in the commercial vehicle space have not crash tested their platforms given their focus on larger sized vehicles."

Canoo has designed the world’s flattest modular “skateboard” platform that allows it to reimagine EV design, maximize usable interior space and support a wide range of vehicle applications. Canoo’s skateboard architecture – a unique, self-contained, independently drivable rolling chassis – directly houses all of the most critical components of an EV. It will feature the market’s first true steer-by-wire platform, which, along with a composite leaf spring suspension, enables the skateboard’s flat structure and maximizes vehicle interior space. Canoo has also developed proprietary electric drivetrain and battery systems which are incorporated into the skateboard. All of Canoo’s EVs will share the same skateboard and utilize different cabins or “top hats” that can be paired on top to create unique vehicles. This highly modular approach will facilitate efficient production at scale and enable Canoo to rapidly develop vehicles serving different market and consumer segments at reduced cost, as the majority of research and development and crash testing is built into the skateboard.

(“Canoo”), a company developing breakthrough electric vehicles (EV) from the ground up, and Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV (“HCAC”) (NASDAQ: HCAC), a special purpose acquisition company, today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement for a business combination that would result in Canoo becoming a publicly listed company. Upon closing of the transaction, the combined operating company will be named Canoo Inc. and will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol “CNOO.” "

https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/merger-announcement,"Canoo is a high-growth EV company, distinguished by its experienced team with an emphasis on engineering expertise and achievement. Canoo has designed the world’s flattest modular “skateboard” platform that allows it to reimagine EV design, maximize usable interior space and support a wide range of vehicle applications. Canoo’s skateboard architecture – a unique, self-contained, independently drivable rolling chassis – directly houses all of the most critical components of an EV. It will feature the market’s first true steer-by-wire platform, which, along with a composite leaf spring suspension, enables the skateboard’s flat structure and maximizes vehicle interior space. Canoo has also developed proprietary electric drivetrain and battery systems which are incorporated into the skateboard. All of Canoo’s EVs will share the same skateboard and utilize different cabins or “top hats” that can be paired on top to create unique vehicles. This highly modular approach will facilitate efficient production at scale and enable Canoo to rapidly develop vehicles serving different market and consumer segments at reduced cost, as the majority of research and development and crash testing is built into the skateboard.

https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/merger-announcement,"Canoo Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Ulrich Kranz said, “Today marks an important milestone of Canoo’s effort to reinvent the development, production and go-to-market model of the electric vehicle industry. Our technology allows for rapid and cost-effective vehicle development through the world’s flattest skateboard architecture, and we believe our subscription model will transform the consumer ownership experience. We are excited to partner with Hennessy Capital and we are energized to begin our journey through a shared passion to deliver an environmentally friendly and versatile vehicle development platform to the market.” "

Unlike any other EV company, Canoo has created a go-to-market strategy that captures both B2C and B2B demand with the same skateboard architecture and technology that has already been validated by key partnerships such as with Hyundai. HCAC has an abiding commitment to sustainable technologies and infrastructure, and we are excited to serve as a catalyst to advance the launch of the Canoo vehicle offerings.” "

Canoo expects to introduce its first model in 2022 that will be targeted at consumers in major urban markets.

https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/82/canoo-inc-announces-first-quarter-2022-results,"""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion."

https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-inc-announces-first-quarter-2022-results,"“EBITDA” is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor’s complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion."

We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures."

https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/103/canoo-inc-announces-first-quarter-2023-results,"""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted Net Loss is defined as net loss adjusted for  stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding."
https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/103/canoo-inc-announces-first-quarter-2023-results,"EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion."
https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/103/canoo-inc-announces-first-quarter-2023-results,"Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures."

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding access to capital, estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches and the achievement of operational milestones, including the ability to meet and/or accelerate anticipated production timelines, Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities, current or anticipated customer orders, and expectations regarding the development of facilities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 30, 2023, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forwardlooking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements."

https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/109/canoo-inc-announces-second-quarter-2023-results,"""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Los""s is defined as net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding."
https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/109/canoo-inc-announces-second-quarter-2023-results,"EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion."
https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/109/canoo-inc-announces-second-quarter-2023-results,"Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures."

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 30, 2023, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements."
